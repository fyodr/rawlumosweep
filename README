This README is written on a 10 minute timer before sharing a link.

To use these scripts, copy "rawlumosweep_inputs.lsf.example" to 
"rawlumosweep_inputs.lsf" and then run "rawlumosweep.lsf" from either the GUI 
or from the command line.

The input file ("rawlumosweep_inputs.lsf") is not tracked by git. Output is 
stored in the local directory; filename is specified in the input file.

The scripts should run smoothly on any up-to-date installation of Lumerical 
MODE Solutions.

Known issues/TODO: 
1. better README: for now, probably best to read through:
      - rawlumosweep.lsf (short!)
      - the example input file (longer, focus on "Sweepable Parameters")
2. other stuff, less urgent
